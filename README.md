    Highwing wants to make some information available to an insurance carrier user based on data that we’ve aggregated from some insurance brokers that we work with. Specifically, we want to give the carrier user the ability to quickly view a summary of all of the business that the broker represents, as well as just the subset of that business that the user’s carrier currently has, side-by-side.
